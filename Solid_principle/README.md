# SOLID Principles Java

In Java, SOLID principles are an object-oriented approach that are applied to software structure design. It is conceptualized by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob). These five principles have changed the world of object-oriented programming, and also changed the way of writing software. It also ensures that the software is modular, easy to understand, debug, and refactor


# Single Responsibility Principle
The single responsibility principle states that every Java class must perform a single functionality. Implementation of multiple functionalities in a single class mashup the code and if any modification is required may affect the whole class. It precise the code and the code can be easily maintained. 

# Open closed principle
The application or module entities the methods, functions, variables, etc. The open-closed principle states that according to new requirements the module should be open for extension but closed for modification. The extension allows us to implement new functionality to the module.
